My Daily diary
<div>
How was my day memorable today ?
<div>
Came from my job 
<div>
Went to play soccer. What I learnt today "When you are taking the ball you can fake to the area where the defender is facing and take the ball to the next area and move forward blocking the ball with the body.
<div>
When the ball is in 18 yard area take short one touch to move around and get comfortable to shoot.
<div>
When you are dribbling when you get past the defender don't slow done just don't break the rhythm.
